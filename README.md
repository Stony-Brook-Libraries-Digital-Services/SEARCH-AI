SEARCH AI

Advancing Academic Library Discovery with Artificial Intelligence

Stony Brook University Libraries is developing SEARCH AI, an AI-powered search tool designed to transform how users engage with the library catalog. This initiative represents the first of its kind in a research library environment, enabling users to interact with the catalog using natural language queries instead of relying solely on traditional keyword searches.

🚀 Project Overview

SEARCH AI is built on an agentic AI framework that parses natural language input (phrases and questions closer to how we speak) and dynamically translates them into refined Boolean queries with relevant filters.

This innovation allows users to:

Conduct searches using everyday language.

Receive more relevant and precise results.

Navigate the catalog more efficiently and intuitively.

🎯 Goals

Improve usability and discoverability within academic library catalogs.

Provide faster, more accurate search results for students, researchers, and faculty.

Explore adaptability across academic libraries, encouraging collaboration and shared innovation.

Advance the University Libraries’ commitment to strategic AI integration.

🛠️ Current Status

SEARCH AI is in the testing and iteration phase. We are:

Actively evaluating performance.

Collecting feedback from colleagues.

Refining the system based on real-world use.

This grassroots effort not only enhances our discovery tools but also builds AI capacity within academic libraries at large.

🌐 Broader Impact

While currently designed for Stony Brook’s catalog, early testing suggests SEARCH AI can be adapted for other academic libraries. In the spirit of open scholarship and transparency, we plan to:

Release SEARCH AI as open-source software.

Publish a technical write-up detailing its design and methodology.

This commitment ensures that the project contributes to the wider research and library community.

📖 Why It Matters

SEARCH AI reflects Stony Brook University Libraries’ dedication to:

Library innovation.

Improved discoverability of research materials.

The evolving landscape of academic research in the digital age.

📜 License

SEARCH AI will be released under an open-source license (TBD). Details forthcoming with the first public release.

Would you like me to also design a visual logo/banner (something lightweight in SVG/PNG) for the top of the README so it immediately stands out on GitHub? That could help brand SEARCH AI more strongly.
