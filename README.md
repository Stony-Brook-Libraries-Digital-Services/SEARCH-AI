# SEARCH AI  

**Advancing Academic Library Discovery with Artificial Intelligence**  

Stony Brook University Libraries is developing **SEARCH AI**, an AI-powered search tool designed to transform how users engage with the library catalog. This initiative enabling users to interact with a full library catalog using **natural language queries** instead of relying solely on traditional keyword searches.  

---

## 🚀 Project Overview  

SEARCH AI is built on an **agentic AI framework** that parses natural language input (phrases and questions closer to how we speak) and dynamically translates them into **refined Boolean queries with relevant filters**.  

This innovation allows users to:  
- Conduct searches using everyday language.  
- Receive more relevant and precise results.  
- Navigate the catalog more efficiently and intuitively.  

---

## 🎯 Goals  

- Improve usability and discoverability within academic library catalogs.  
- Provide faster, more accurate search results for students, researchers, and faculty.  
- Explore adaptability across academic libraries, encouraging collaboration and shared innovation.  
- Advance the University Libraries’ commitment to strategic AI integration.

## 🛠️ Current Status  

SEARCH AI is currently in the **testing and iteration phase**.  
We are:  
- Actively evaluating performance.  
- Collecting valuable feedback from colleagues.  
- Refining the system based on real-world use.

## 🌐 Broader Impact  

While currently designed for Stony Brook’s catalog, we think SEARCH AI can be adapted for other academic libraries, within and outside the Alma/Primo landscape.  

In the spirit of **open scholarship and transparency**, we plan to:  
- Release SEARCH AI as **open-source software**.  
- Publish a **technical write-up** detailing its design and methodology.
